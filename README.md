## High-Speed Native Plugins with C++, WASM, and Rust for JavaScript Engines

This sdk uses **Lerna** to manage multiple packages that integrate **JavaScript**, **Rust**, **WASM**, **C++**, and modern JavaScript engines like **Deno**, **Bun**, and **Node.js**. The goal is to build high-performance native plugins leveraging **Rust** and **C++** for **JavaScript** engines with WebAssembly support.

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies at the root of the project:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. To run all servers in the monorepo, use:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. To stop all running servers, press `Ctrl + C`.

This README is streamlined to provide the essentials for quickly setting up and running your high-speed native plugins within the monorepo owned by Shyam.M (Node-Js Architect).
